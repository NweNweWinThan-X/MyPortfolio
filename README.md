# Minimalist Engineering Portfolio

A high-performance, minimalist portfolio designed for a Senior Software Engineer profile.

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework:** Pure HTML/JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN for zero-build overhead)
- **Deployment:** [e.g., Vercel / GitHub Pages]
- **Design Philosophy:** Performance-first, minimalist UI focusing on project metrics and system architecture.

## Why No Build Step?
This project intentionally avoids a complex build pipeline to achieve:
1. **Instant Loading:** No JavaScript hydration delays.
2. **Infinite Compatibility:** Can be maintained and deployed from any environment (even legacy systems).
3. **Low Maintenance:** Zero dependency vulnerabilities.
